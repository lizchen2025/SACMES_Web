# Requests Package Fix

## Issue

Agent executable failed with error:
```
requests package is not installed -- cannot send HTTP requests!
```

## Root Cause

The `requests` package is required by `python-socketio` for HTTP transport but was not included in the build dependencies.

## Solution

### Files Modified

1. **requirements_agent_minimal.txt**
   - Added: `requests>=2.25.0`

2. **build_agent_minimal.bat**
   - Updated pip install command to include requests

3. **build_agent_exe.bat**
   - Updated pip install command to include requests

4. **build_agent_console.bat**
   - Updated pip install command to include requests

5. **test_dependencies.bat**
   - Updated dependency test to include requests

6. **agent_minimal.spec**
   - Added `'requests'` and `'urllib3'` to hiddenimports

7. **agent_console.spec**
   - Added `'requests'` and `'urllib3'` to hiddenimports

## Build Command

All build scripts now install both required packages:
```batch
pip install "python-socketio>=5.0.0,<6.0.0" "requests>=2.25.0"
```

## Verification

Test the fix:
```batch
build_agent_console.bat
dist\SACMES_Agent_Debug.exe
```

The console version will display any remaining dependency errors.

## Technical Details

### Dependency Tree
```
agent.py
└── python-socketio 5.x
    ├── engineio
    ├── websocket-client
    └── requests (HTTP transport)
        └── urllib3
```

### PyInstaller Configuration

Both spec files now include:
```python
hiddenimports=[
    'socketio',
    'engineio',
    'websocket',
    'requests',
    'urllib3',
]
```
